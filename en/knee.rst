The kneeÂ module
================




(Removed in 2.3) This is a Python re-implementation of the package
import mechanism that was introduced in Python 1.5. Since this is
already supported by the standard interpreter, this module is mostly
provided to show how things are done in there. It does work, though.
Just import the module to enable it.

**Example: Using the knee module**

.. sourcecode:: python

    
    # File: `knee-example-1.py <knee-example-1.py>`__
    
    import knee
    
    # that's all, folks!
